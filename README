You will need to add a file called init/configuration.rb with contents similar to:

#start file
DBCONN = { :adapter => 'mysql',
:database => 'camping',
:username => 'root',
:password => '',
:host => 'localhost' }

EZCRYPTO1, EZCRYPTO2 = "long random string", "long random string"

PORTFOLIO_PASSWORD = "random string"
#end file

This file contains the database configuration hash (DBCONN), the encryption key and salt for reauthrss, and the password for the portfolio administration.
